                        Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis has been Japan’s capital since 1869.
                        The Greater Tokyo is also known as the most populous metropolitan area in the world and the city is still the world's largest with 37 million inhabitants.
                        Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. </br>
                        With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital").

                        Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945..
                        Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.

                <p>

                    </br>
                    </br>
                        Asakusa is the center of Tokyo's shitamachi (low city), one of Tokyo's districts, where an atmosphere of the Tokyo of past decades survives.
                        Asakusa's main attraction is Sensoji, a very popular Buddhist temple, built in the 7th century. The temple is approached via the Nakamise, a shopping street that has been providing temple visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks and tourist souvenirs for centuries.
                        Asakusa can easily be explored on foot. Alternatively, you can consider a guided tour on a rickshaw.

                  <h4> The Torii Gates</h4>
                <p>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                        The torii is simply described as the entrance to a Shintō shrine, dividing our profane human world from the sacred home of the Shintō gods (kami 神). The torii also protects the kami.
                        The kanji for torii could literally be translated into “where the bird is”.
                        But what does Shintō have to do with birds? There is actually a quite convincing explanation to this to be found in Japanese mythology – the myth “ama no iwato”. </br>
                        About their color : While the red color of the shrine gates symbolizes vitality and protection against evil and, practically, serves as a preservative, because it`s made of mercury, white on the other hand is the original color of torii and stands for sacredness.

                      </br>
                            Ueno Park grounds were originally part of Kaneiji Temple, which used to be one of the city's largest and wealthiest temples. In 1873, the temple grounds were converted into one of Japan's first public Western style parks.
                      </br>
                            Today Ueno Park is famous for the many museums found on its grounds, especially the Tokyo National Museum, the National Museum for Western Art, the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum and the National Science Museum. It is also home to Ueno Zoo, Japan's first zoological garden.

                </br>  
                        The most popular type of sushi today, nigiri-sushi originated as a fast-food dish in Tokyo. Consisting of a piece of seafood put onto a small ball of rice, it takes much less time and effort to prepare than more traditional sushi dishes. </br>
                        Nigiri-sushi are served at all sushi restaurants from inexpensive conveyor belt sushi to Michelin-starred restaurants. The Tsukiji Outer Market is one of the best places to eat fresh sushi.

                        Soba noodles are a popular dish in many regions of Japan. In Tokyo, they were particularly popular during the Edo Period, and can be found all across the city today, including at standing soba eateries and establishments specialized in soba. </br>
                        The dipping sauce used in Tokyo is traditionally relatively thick, and diners are encouraged to dip their noodles into it only lightly.

                      Tempura
                      Another of Japan's most famous dishes, tempura also underwent major development in the capital city. Before the Edo Period, mainly vegetables were used for tempura, but Edo cooks started to deep fry seafood from Edo Bay in tempura batter, resulting in the more varied dish we know today.
                      A visit to a specialized tempura restaurant (tempura-ya) is the recommended way to enjoy tempura.

                              Everything starts just as the sun is setting at 5pm and the procession finishes promptly at 8pm – on both days.</br>
                              10,000 dancers and musicians are expected and more than 1 million people turning up to watch.
